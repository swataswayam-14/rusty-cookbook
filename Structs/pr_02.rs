//Using Tuple Structs without named fileds to create different types

//tuple structs

struct Color(i32, i32, i32);

fn main(){
    let black = Color(0,0,0);
    let white = color(255,255,255);
    let origin = Point(0,0,0);

    //Note that the black and origin values are different types because theyâ€™re instances of different tuple structs. Each struct you define is its own type, even though the fields within the struct might have the same types. 
    // For example, a function that takes a parameter of type Color cannot take a Point as an argument, even though both types are made up of three i32 values.
