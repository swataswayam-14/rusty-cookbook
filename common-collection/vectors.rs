//BELOW PROGRAM GIVES AN ERROR 
//AS HERE WE hold an immutable reference to the first element in a vector and try to add an element to the end.

//vectors put the values next to each other in memory, adding a new element onto the end of the vector might require allocating new memory and copying the old elements to the new space, if there isnâ€™t enough room to put all the elements next to each other where the vector is currently stored. In that case, the reference to the first element would be pointing to deallocated memory.

    // let mut v = vec![1,2,3,4];

    // let first:&i32 = &v[0];

    // v.push(9);

    // println!("The first element is {}", first);
